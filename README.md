# Shadow-of-ghosts-macOS

DISCLAIMER: I did not write nor contribute to the making of this game. All i did was used the source code for the windows version of the game and compiled it into a macOS compatible app. Full game credit goes to Wdangcan at: https://www.patreon.com/WdangcanC



The code i have uploaded here is in 2 folders, one is the source code (file with the extension tar.gz) which is not required to run the game, it is there for anyone who would like to edit or just take a look. The file needed to run the game is the Game.zip folder.

# How to play the game

1. Get a computer running macOS, if you have a windows PC use the download file at: https://www.patreon.com/WdangcanC

2. Download the app, specifically the Game.zip folder from the github repository

3. extract the Game.zip folder and open it

4. run the Shadow of Ghosts.app file

* If your mac doesnt allow you to open the file due to System Integrity Protection (blocking the file as it is downloaded from the internet), Control click/Right click on the Shadow of Ghosts.app file and then click open on the popup.
